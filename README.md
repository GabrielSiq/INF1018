## INF1018 - Basic Software/Computer Systems

**2013.2**

Projects for the Basic Software/Computer course at PUC-Rio.


## Project 1 (T1)

The first project is an implementation of 16-bit integers in C. Basic operations are provided, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and bit shifting, as well as comparator functions.


## Project 2 (T2)

The second project is an implementation in C of a very simple programming language. The code is read from a file and the corresponding machine code is written to `malloc`-ed memory. A function pointer points to the program's entry point, allowing the user of the library to run the generated code.
